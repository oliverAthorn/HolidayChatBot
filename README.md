# Holiday Chat Agent

The 'Holiday Chat Agent' is a Blazor based web app which can take user input and created recommendations based on their preferences. 

This project was the final project of my apprenticeship, and had to be completed within five days. As a result there are numerous elements I would refactor given a longer time frame. This includes retrieving questions from a database and ensuring that all front-end logic is housed in the service layer.
